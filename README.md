# Welcome to the HoursLogger Timer Challenge

The point of this exercise is to build a simple timer with a start and stop button. The timer should count up every second and display it's time in hours, minutes, and seconds. Use timer.html, timer.js, and timer.css to get started. Feel free add additional features or styling!

## Instructions
1. Fork this repo by clicking the "Fork" button on Github. Forking creates a personal copy of the repo under your Github profile.
2. Clone the forked repo so it's on your dev machine.
3. Work on programming the timer and make commits as necessary.
4. Push your updates to your forked repo.
5. Contact drew@hourslogger.com for review or questions.
